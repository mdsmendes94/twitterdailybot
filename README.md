# twitterdailybot
Simple bot using tweepy and schedule libraries to post a random image from a folder every day at a given hour.

Set up
------
1. Request a Dev account at https://dev.twitter.com/apps/. It doesn't take long to request.

2. Create and authorise an app with read and WRITE access at:

3. Request the Consumer Keys and Access Token and Secret Tokens. That's how the bot is going to log on twitter.

Now that you have both Python and Twitter Dev Account with an app set to Read and Write. It's all a matter of adding the path you want and setting your keys inside the bot.
